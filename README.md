## Overview

The fourth week introduced several essential components used in real-world Java applications. Key topics included working with Java Collections Framework, handling runtime errors with exceptions, using generics for type safety, performing input and output operations, understanding new features introduced in Java 8, and writing testable code using regular expressions and JUnit.

## Topics Covered

### 01 - Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing Functions
- Stack implementation and operations (push, pop, peek)
- Queue implementation and operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- Introduction to HashMaps
- Basic hashing concepts and functions

### 02 - Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Basic understanding of how each sort works and its complexity

### 03 & 04 - Linear & Binary Search
- Linear search implementation
- Binary search implementation
- Prerequisites for binary search (sorted data)
- Time complexity comparison

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Week 1â€“3 content (Java basics, OOP, and DSA)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Prior Knowledge on Maven projects and JUnit testing procedure.
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse
